#Duckbills

This is the API for a web application that facilitates the splitting up of bills between roommates.  The person whos name is on the bill can register as a treasurer.  They can then creat roomates and assign portions (or total amounts) of bills to them with apllicable due dates.  Anyone using this API has the option of searching by bill and by asignee.

Possibilities for future versions will support voting on roomates (based on payment history) and messaging/alerts.
